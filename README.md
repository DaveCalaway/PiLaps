## Install & Run
#### Preliminal steps
You need only this package on Raspbian Jessie: `sudo apt-get install libav-tools`  

Run this command on terminal: `vcgencmd get_camera`  


**Supported** and **Detected** must be **1**, or the script does not run.   
IF Supported is 0, run this command on terminal `sudo raspi-config` and enable the camera.   
If Detected is 0, the camera is not connected to the Raspi.   

**Download** the script folder from GitHub or run this command: `git clone https://github.com/DaveCalaway/PiLapse`   
**Install** The folder "PiLapse" MUST stay at "/home/pi/" and you can install the script by running the `python3 Install.py`.  
The script will start autonomously every time the RPi boot.  

If do you want to use a RGB led, check if it's an Anode or Cathode common!  
If it's an Anode common, the code is ok, but if you have an Cathode common, open the `PiLapse.py` file and edit *Anode = 0* in the *VARIABLES*.  

## Operation Mode:
### Terminal mode
This terminal version help you to control the period, frequency and folder name for a timelapse.  
You can run it by run the `python3 PiLapse_terminal.py` and follow the guide.   


### Button mode
The Daemon version help you to control the TimeLapse with an external button, it takes 1 pic every 10 second by default.   
You can change this default period by opening the `PiLapse.py` file and edit the *VARIABLES* -> freq_button.  
It creates a folder called "year-month-day time".  
The Daemon run continuously.

If you want to change those, open the `PiLapse.py` file and edit the *VARIABLES*.  

## Service status
Very useful command to control the service called "**PiLapse.service**":
* sudo systemctl start PiLapse.service
* sudo systemctl stop PiLapse.service
* sudo systemctl status PiLapse.service:  
  * This is the most useful command, that checks what the service doing
* sudo systemctl enable PiLapse.service

## Hardware test
RasPi 1 | RasPi 2 | RasPi3
------------ | ------------- | -------------
not tested | Tested | not tested
Probably works | Beta | Probably works
